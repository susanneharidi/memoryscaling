This repository contains the code and data for the paper "Context-size and set size effects: The relevance of specific cues when
searching long-term memory" by Susanne Haridi, Mirko Thalmann, and Eric Schulz.

The repository is structured as follows:

- `online_experiment/`: Contains the code for the 3 online experiments and the one pilot study. The code is written in JavaScript and HTML and uses the jsPsych library. The php code has been removed.
- `ExperimentDataAndAnalysis/`: Contains the code for the analysis of the data. The code is written in R. As well as the data from the experiments. The each experiment has its own data folder and the data is stored in csv files. The data has been preprocessed to ensure anonymity.

The code is provided as is and is not actively maintained. If you have any questions, please contact Susanne Haridi (susanneharidi@helmholtz-munich.de).
