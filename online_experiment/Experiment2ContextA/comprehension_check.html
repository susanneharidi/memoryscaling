                <p><b>Congratulations on completing the practice trials! </b></p>
                <p><b>We will now ask you three short questions to make sure you understood the task. </b></p>
                <br>
                <p>You will need to get all of the answers correct to proceed to the next experiment, so please read the questions carefully!</p><br>

            <h3>Here is a reminder about how the experiment works, just in case you need it:</h3>
                <p><b>Feel free to skip this part if you think you got it by now. If you get the comprehension questions wrong, you will be returned to this section. </b></p>
                <br>
                <p>The experiment consists of four blocks that each have three parts.</p>

                <p><b>1. Word pair learning</b></p>
                <p>In the first part of each block you <b>learn a list of word pairs</b>. <br> Your task is to remember what words are associated with each other. <br> You also get the chance to practice the word pairs, by typing each word once given the other as a cue. <br> You will later (in the third part of each block) have to recall one of the words (the target) based on the other word (the cue). <br> Either word can later be the cue. <br>The number of word pairs you have to learn in each block varies from block to block.</p>
                
                <p><b>2. Letter memory task</b></p>
                <p>In the second part you will be performing a short <b>letter memory task</b>. <br> your task here is to recall a sequence of letters and type them in in the correct order once you are prompted to do so. <br> You have limited time to do so. </p>
                
                <p><b>3. Word recall task</b></p>
                <p>And finally, in the third part of each block you have to <b>recall the words you learned in the first part</b> of each block.</p>
                <p>The words have to be recalled using one of the words in each word pair as a cue. So if you learned the word pair <b>ruin - shape</b> and we present you with the word <b>ruin</b> your task is to recall the word <b>shape</b>.<br> During the cue presentation we ask you to <b>only</b> press the spacebar once you have recalled the target word. Once you have done so, you have only a few seconds to type in the first three letters of the target word. 
                    <br> You can also type in the whole word, but only the first three letters have to be correct for you to get points.</p><br>
                <p>If you really cannot recall a word, you still need to press the space bar to continue, but then please respond by typing <b>0</b> (zero) into the response field.</p><br>
                <p>Each block is entirely seperate. This means, that we will <b>never</b> ask you about words from previous blocks.<br> You will be allowed to take a short break of max 1 minute between the blocks. <br> You will also receive feedback about your performance at the end of each block.</p><br>
                <p>Accuracy is very imprortant for this experiment, but please also try to be as <b>fast</b> as possible, when trying to remember the target word!</p><br>
                <p>Ok. Now letâ€™s test your understanding of the task.</p><br>
